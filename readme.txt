  this is a simple single page flight booking app
  in this stage it wont do much.
  // enhancements
    //ajax usage
    live city search added. the search is using teleport.org
    public api to fetch list of cities that match the query term
    //store data locally
    now the input data will be saved in localStorage and when
    the client re-open or refresh the window the inputs will be
    populated with previous data that they inserted
